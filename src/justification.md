# Justification

There exists a variety of software release management and quality assurance tools to automate processes such as linting, CI/CD monitoring, and static analysis. However, most of them operate in isolation, requiring developers to manually switch between platforms to verify the status of each repository and make sure that releases are ready. This method is inefficient, increases the possibility of human mistakes, and makes it very challenging to provide an overall view of the health of the repositories, and taking into account the high number of them that are managed inside the Hub it makes it very difficult to keep up to date with the status of each one of them. Given the mentioned before, the decision to develop a new solution rather than relying solely on existing tools is justified by several factors.

Firstly, while existing solutions provide individual functionalities, there is no single tool that consolidates all necessary checks, release processes, and repository monitoring into a centralized, automated system. For example, Jenkins automates CI/CD but does not provide detailed code insights or manage version updates, while SonarQube performs static code analysis but does not integrate with release management workflows. Scouter fills this gap by centralizing these tools and automating the tasks.

Secondly, most existing tools follow a generic approach that does not fully align with the specific needs of the Digital Finance Hub. A custom-built solution provides personalized sanity checks, including company-specific rules and validations, automated release candidate preparation, and a customized visualization dashboard (Jared) that provides a real-time overview of repository status, allowing teams to prioritize critical issues. By developing a new tool, we guarantee that the specific requirements of the Hub are met without the limitations of other existing solutions.

Thirdly, manually verifying repositories is time-consuming and prone to error, especially when managing over 50. Existing solutions still require users to manually check different tools, merge results, and coordinate releases. With Scouter, sanity checks are performed automatically without requiring developers to run them manually, and release management steps (such as versioning and release note updates) are fully automated. Jared's dashboard provides immediate visibility of issues, removing the need to check multiple platforms separately. Thanks to this, it will be possible to manage all the repositories, speed up development cycles, and improve overall software reliability.

Lastly, unlike existing tools, which may have limited flexibility for integrating new features, the proposed solution is designed to be scalable and extensible. Future enhancements could include AI-powered release note generation (using LLM models like ChatGPT to clean and format documentation) or expanded support for additional development frameworks and repository management tools.
