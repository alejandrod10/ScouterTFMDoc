# Methodology

In order to achieve the objectives of the project, an Agile methodology will be implemented. This approach is suitable for adapting to changes and new requirements that may appear over time. Specifically, Scrum methodology will be used, which involves splitting the project's development into sprintsâ€”short, time-boxed periods when a team works to complete a set amount of tasks.

Since the project aims to develop a specific solution for the Digital Finance Hub's needs at Novartis, some aspects of this methodology have been adjusted. Bi-weekly follow-up meetings will be scheduled with the project manager. During these meetings, we will review progress, analyze achievements, and identify potential obstacles. This regular communication will ensure that the project maintains a clear direction and allows for necessary adjustments along the way. We will identify specific user stories that represent the needs and goals of the team. These stories will be transformed into concrete tasks and functionalities to implement in each sprint.

To ensure that objectives are met and progress is tracked, Bitbucket will be used for code version control. This will enable the team to monitor changes and avoid releasing versions with errors. Additionally, Jira will be used for planning, task tracking, and assigning responsibilities.

Implementing Agile methodology and using tracking tools guarantees that the project's development will be consistent, efficient, and aligned with the established objectives and requirements.
